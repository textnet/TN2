# TN2 â€“ 2nd Generation of Textnet.

This is an Excalibur+Electron prototype of the TXTNET.

## Boilerplate setup

* [x] cleanup yarn/npm
* [x] copy minimal electron
* [ ] find a way to run it on server

## Generic console interface
* [ ] readline cycle
* [ ] command/subcommand mapping

## Development
* [ ] interfaces
* [ ] events
* [ ] overall approach (think of)
* [ ] network / no-network configuration





## Old things
    npm install   -- after cloning the repo
    ./start.sh    -- to enter the debug cycle
    yarn dist     -- to make distro package
