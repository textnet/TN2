# TN2 – 2nd Generation of Textnet.

This is an Excalibur+Electron prototype of the TXTNET.

## Generic console interface
* [x] readline cycle
* [x] command/subcommand mapping
* [x] check both electron and node

## Boilerplate
* [x] baseline interfaces
* [ ] storage abstraction
* [ ] network / no-network configuration
* [ ] discovery


## Stages
1. Node stub
2. Planets on the node
3. Network of planets (discovery, online, offline)
5. Things (create, destroy) — with Planes
6. Consoles (create, destroy, connect, disconnect)
7. Text commands
8. Limbo
9. Anima
10. GUI


## Old things
    npm install   -- after cloning the repo
    ./start.sh    -- to enter the debug cycle
    yarn dist     -- to make distro package
